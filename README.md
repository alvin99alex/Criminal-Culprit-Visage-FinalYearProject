# Criminal Culprit Visage
Criminal Face Sketch and Construction and Recognition (My B.E. Final Year Project)

## Description
Recent advancements in forensic science highlight the ongoing challenges with hand-drawn facial sketches, which remain labor-intensive and often limited in accuracy when integrated into modern recognition and criminal identification technologies. Addressing these concerns, we introduce a standalone application designed to empower users in generating composite facial sketches through intuitive drag-and-drop features. This innovative tool leverages deep learning algorithms and cloud-based infrastructure to swiftly and accurately match these composite sketches with extensive police databases. By eliminating the traditional reliance on forensic artists, our solution promises enhanced efficiency and reliability in criminal identification processes, marking a significant step forward in forensic technology.
